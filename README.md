# Integration-vs-non-integration
Contains raw data from the paper, "Differentiating between integration and non-integration strategies in perceptual decision making".

The .mat file associated with each subject contais three variables -- dataFR, dataVSD, and dataSpeeded -- which correspond to three
trial types each subject performed. Each variable is an nTrials x 3 matrix with the following format: 

[signed_motion_coherence   choice(1==right, 0==left)  RT or stimulus duration].

Further data/code will be found in the final version of the paper.
